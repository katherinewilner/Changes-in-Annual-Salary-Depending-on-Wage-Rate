# Baltimore City Government and Yearly Wage Changes
## In this project, I analyzed the differences in annual income between workers with salaries less than $30,000 and those with salaries greater than $30,000. 
### I chose to divide the data between these two groups because I wanted to see if there were patterns in changes in salaries. For example, if raises were continuously given to those with higher salaries, then there could be issues regarding wage discrimination within the city government.
This is important for a city to be aware of because if raises are not distributed equally, then those who might need them the most (those making less than $30,000) could potentially find themselves in debt, or having to seek a second job, despite those with higher salaries being able to have consistent, reliable jobs that increase on par with inflation.###

#### These graphics and data were obtained through https://opportunityatlas.org/. In order to sort the data, I downloaded data sets including average rent prices from every tract in the country. To sort out rent prices for Los Angeles and Baltimore, I created two pivot tables, one that only included rent prices with the information "Los Angeles, CA" in it, and the other with only information from "Baltimore, MD". After, I scaled the two charts to have equal axis so data would not be skewed when being analyzed.
