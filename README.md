# Baltimore City Government and Yearly Wage Changes
## In this project, I analyzed the differences in annual income between workers with salaries less than $30,000 and those with salaries greater than $30,000. 
### I chose to divide the data between these two groups because I wanted to see if there were patterns in changes in salaries. For example, if raises were continuously given to those with higher salaries, then there could be issues regarding wage discrimination within the city government.
### This is important for a city to be aware of because if raises are not distributed equally, then those who might need them the most (those making less than $30,000) could potentially find themselves in debt, or having to seek a second job, despite those with higher salaries being able to have consistent, reliable jobs that increase on par with inflation.
### Here, we can see the differences between both 2017 and 2018 wages, but we can also see how differently less than $30,000 workers are distributed when compared to those who make over $30,000. As we can see, wages increased more for those who make less than $30,000, which is a good thing. However, we can also see the sporadic nature of salary rates for these employees. Those who make over $30,000 have very reliable, gradual increases in salary. We can also see an increase in workers who make more than $30,000, which again, is promising for the city.

### One key data point that should be emphasized in analyzing these graphs is the difference in slope. Those who make less than $30,000 have a steeper slope, indicating that there are 1. less workers in this category and 2. there is higher variation amongst salaries. Regarding those who make more than $30,000, salaries are much more consistent and gradual, with the exception of the acceleration at the very highest level of salary.

#### These graphics and data were obtained through https://data.baltimorecity.gov/. In order to sort the data, I downloaded data sets for employee salary for 2017 and 2018. Then, I sorted the data into two categories, one with less than $30,000 salaries and one with more than $30,000. I used a linear regression line to clearly demonstrate the patterns on each graph.
